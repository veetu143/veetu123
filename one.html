Hereâ€™s a simple HTML program to create a basic webpage:

Copy the code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
    <p>This is a simple HTML program to demonstrate basic structure.</p>
    <a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example</a>
</body>
</html>

Explanation:
<!DOCTYPE html>: Declares the document type as HTML5.
<html>: The root element of the HTML document.
<head>: Contains metadata like the title of the page.
<body>: Contains the visible content of the webpage.
<h1>: A heading tag for the title.
<p>: A paragraph tag for descriptive text.
